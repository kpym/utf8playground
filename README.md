# UTF-8 Normalization Playground

This is a very basic, vanilla JavaScript, html and css project that allows you to play with UTF-8 normalization. It uses the `String.prototype.normalize` method to present the normalized form of a string in NFC, NFD, NFKC and NFKD forms.

You can try it out at https://kpym.github.io/utf8playground.
